## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It's been a minute since I've used plain 'ol CSS. I usually reach for Tailwind at this point. Remembering some of the syntax proved to be tricky. Thankful for MDN!

### Useful resources

- [Border Radius Calculator](https://borderradiuscalculator.vercel.app/) - A nifty tool that helps you figure out proper border radii.

Shoutout to my brother and (sometimes reluctant) mentor [Ryan Furrer](https://www.ryanfurrer.com/). It's nice to have a Design Engineer that I can go to when I know something is off, but I just *don't know what*.
